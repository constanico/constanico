As a recent Computer Science graduate from BINUS University, I am excited to embark on a career in software development. During my internship at PT Bank Central Asia (BCA), I contributed to developing internal backend services that related to database and transaction service using Kotlin, Java, Spring Boot Framework, Oracle Database.

I am passionate about solving problems and continually learning new technologies. I am looking to join a team where I can continue innovate and develop software.
